This website is a quick, simple way for you to submit a public records request to the City of Oakland. That's not all. Through this site, you can: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>monitor your request</li>
<li>search through past public records requests</li>
<li>view all documents released by the City</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Every message sent through this website is completely public.</b> This makes easier for you (and city employees!) to understand what happens to each request. 
</p>
<p>
We can display your request because the California Public Records Act gives everyone access to documents, photos, emails, texts, audio recordings, and data about the City and its business. To make you feel comfortable, we don't allow the public to view your name or contact information.
