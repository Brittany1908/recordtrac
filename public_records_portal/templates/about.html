The City of Oakland and Code for America are testing a new web application that will help the city better manage its public records requests. The public will also have the ability to quickly submit public records requests, search through past requests, and better understand how they are fulfilled. All requests submitted by a member of the public will be sent to the Open Government Coordinator in the City Attorney's office and be treated as a normal public records requests.
</p>
<p>
Currently city employees have the ability to do the following through the web application: 
<ul>
<li>Upload a document or post a link to fulfill a public records request</li>
<li>Explain the records requester if they need to pick up hard copies of a document and provide them with details about where and when they need to pick up the record</li>
<li>Ask a question to the requester to better understand what he or she needs</li>
<li>Provide reasons about why it may take additional time to answer a request</li>
<li>Indicate a records request has been fulfilled</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
When a city employee sends a message or uploads a document, the information can immediately be viewed by members of the public. An email will also automatically be sent to the individual who submitted the request with a status update. 
</p>
<p>
In the next couple of months, the web application will be improved as features are added and changed. Your feedback is valuable. Please send any questions and/or concerns to oakland@codeforamerica.org.
