public-records
==============

This is a portal to display public record requests to the community and the City of Oakland.


## Installation

This application requires [Postgres](http://www.postgresapp.com/) and Xcode developer tools to be installed.

    /Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/MacOS/bin/psql
    CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;

If you are using a standard Postgres installation or from [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) you can also use:

        createdb publicrecords

In a new window:

    git clone git://github.com/codeforamerica/public-records.git
    cd public-records
    sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
    mkdir uploads
	python 

Then from the Python prompt type the following commands to load database

	from prflask import db
	db.create_all()
	quit()


Save example-settings.cfg as settings.cfg and update relevant fields. To test e-mail, sign up for a free account with SendGrid and provide the username and password in MAIL_USERNAME and MAIL_PASSWORD.

## Run locally

To use the application locally, in a new window:

    gunicorn -w 2 -u your_user_name prflask:app
