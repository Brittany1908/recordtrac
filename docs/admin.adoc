=== Best Practices to Consider

Content  should only be removed or edited if sensitive or confidential information is revealed. If this happens, you should:

* Save a copy of the original message. (This will have to be done outside of RecordTrac. There is no way to hide a message from public view.) 
* Edit the message to indicate why it needs to be removed. 
* Notify the requester why their post or answer was removed.
* Provide guidance to the requester on how they can get the record they need. 

If a city staff member enters information incorrectly, simply add a note explaining the mistake. 

If a member of the public enters incorrect information,  the requester (or a city staff member) can add a note correcting  the mistake. 

Sometimes it’s necessary to create a new request. If a new request must be created, we suggest you do the following:
* Create a new request with the proper information.
* In the old request, include a note explaining what is wrong with it and a link to the new request.
* Close out the old request.
* In the new request, reference and/or provide a link to the old request. 

Although RecordTrac has a spam filter, every once in a while it may receive spam. When confronted with spam, close the request with a note indicating why it is not a public records request.  If there is a large amount of spam requests, it is appropriate to simply remove the spam. 

If a record needs to be removed. It not only has to be deleted on RecordTrac, it has to be removed from Scribd as well.
