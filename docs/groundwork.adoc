== Laying the Groundwork

To redeploy RecordTrac, you need support from key stakeholders _within_ government. The administrator or elected official in charge of overseeing public records request must agree to use this system, and instruct their colleagues to do so. 

RecordTrac assumes there is a contact for a given municipality or department within the municipality to handle public records requests. If a government agency has no process at all in place, but is interested in using the system, they could start with one ‘champion’ that is knowledgeable about who has access to different records. The champion can then route requests to the proper parties within government who may have the documents or information a requester needs.
