{{ d['/public_records_portal/models.py|idio|asciisyn']['Request'] }}

== What else can you do?

We're using Flask-Restless to generate the API, and https://flask-restless.readthedocs.org/en/latest/requestformat.html[their documentation] is a lot more comprehesive, so you should check it out to learn more ways in which you can interact with our API.

The objects you have access to, in addition to request, are note, record, owner, QA and subscriber. You can read more about those http://codeforamerica.github.io/public-records/docs/1.0.0/models.html[here]. At this time, you can only make GET requests.
