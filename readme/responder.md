# How to use RecordTrac as an agency employee 

## Search for a record

RecordTrac displays all current and past records requests at http://records.oaklandnet.com/requests[records.oaklandnet.com/requests].

The table displays the following information:

* '#': Each request is assigned a unique number. You can easily track requests with this number by visiting **update** http://records.oaklandnet.com/requests[records.oaklandnet.com/track].**update**
* Received: This shows the date the request was received.  If a request wasn't originally submitted through RecordTrac, it may take agency employees a day or two to enter it into the system.
* Request: This is the message sent to the agency by a member of the public. Sometimes agnecy employees will enter a request on behalf of an individual. If the requested document contains confidential information that may violate the security or privacy of a requester, the public will only see a short description of the document.
* Department: The agency department where the point of contact works. Multiple departments may be involved in one request, but the Point of Contact's department will only be displayed. 
* Point of Contact: The 'Point of Contact' is the employee responsible for providing the requester with the information they need. Sometimes agency employees from several departments will be needed to respond to one public records request. They will be added as Helpers, but they will not be displayed on this particular web page. 

	*☟ NOTE: Requesters are not able to search by or view the following two columns. ☟*

* Due: This shows the date the request is due.  The date is calculated from an admin-configured response time. 
* Requester: The requester's name, if provided by the requester.  If no name was provided, it will display as "N/A".


### Search options

Agency staff are able to search all requests by:

### Filter and sort

Agency staff can filter the search by selecting a view that shows:

* Requests in which the currently logged in responder is marked as either a Point of Contact or a Helper.
* Requests with "Open", "Closed", "Due Soon", and "Overdue" status
* Date range in which the request was received
* Date range in which the request is due
* Department in which the point of contact for that request resides

Agency staff can also sort the requests by:

* Request number (#)
* Date the request was received
* Request text 
* Due date

## Make a new request
Agency staff can submit a message to the agency  requesting a public record.

* Some contact information is optional, although we strongly encourage the requester to provide an email address as this is the only way they can receive status updates on their request. 
* There is no limit to the amount of text a requester can put in the request field.
* Requesters are able to enter the department they want the request sent to or the type of document they need. 
* The department or document type field is used to select which person initially receives the request. 
* If a department is not selected, the request is automatically routed to an agency employee who will route it for the requester. 

### Responder-specific fields

Most municipalities allow an individual to submit a public records request any way they please, including by mail, fax, and over the phone.

If the receipt date is different than the submission date, agency staff may alter the receipt date.  For example, if a paper form is received two days before the request is entered into RecordTrac, it is appropriate to mark the receipt date as two days earlier.

*NOTE: This does not alter the creation date, which is stored elsewhere.*
